## Import the pipeline

If you navigate to the pipelines page (this can be found in the navigation bar on the left-hand-side) and then can see the pipeline under `MY PIPELINES & TOOLS` continue to step 2

Otherwise, you will need to import it.

To import the pipeline you need to:
- Go to the pipelines page
- Click the green `New` button (top right)
- `Select` the GitHub icon to import the Nextflow pipeline from GitHub
- Paste the URL of our pipeline [`https://github.com/lifebit-ai/splicing-pipelines-nf`](https://github.com/lifebit-ai/splicing-pipelines-nf)
- Name the pipeline, eg `splicing-pipeline`
- (Optional:) enter a pipeline description
- Click `Next` & `Create pipeline` :tada:
